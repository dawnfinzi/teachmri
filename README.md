# Psych 204A (An introduction to human neuroimaging using magnetic resonance)

These are Matlab tutorial live scripts we use for homeworks and experimenting with MRI principles. 

The key directory for Psych 204A is **tutorials**. That directory contains the main tutorials as LiveScripts (tls_mri*.mlx) as well some simple utility functions.

We suggest that you use 'git clone' to download this repository to your computer.  If you clone the directory, you can get updates with "git pull" in the future.  It is possible to download the repository as a zip file from the <>Code tab, but that is not preferred.

To run, please make sure you add the whole download to your Matlab path.  You can do this by changing into the main directory and running

    addpath(genpath(pwd)).

This repository will contine to change over time.  If you enjoy programming and want to work on some tutorials with me, let me know!
